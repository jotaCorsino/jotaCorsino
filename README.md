In the future, I intend to formalize my training by starting a degree in systems analysis and development, as I believe it is important for a professional to be trained in their field. I currently study on my own through courses on the internet and am also helped by friends who work in the area.

## About me
I've been a Graphic Designer for 8 years, I've always worked in agencies and I thought I would work with Design for the rest of my life, because I have an appreciation for the studies in the area, but I ended up not being fulfilled and slowly I lost interest, which led me to look for new areas of study.

I've always been a curious person, I like to try new things, since I was little I've found it difficult to fit into a single area, I ended up becoming a "multidisciplinary enthusiast", which helps me a lot in the area of Design, which ends up requiring this at a certain point, but my will changed after I started experimenting with HTML and CSS as an expansion of my skills as a Graphic Designer, because that was the gateway for me to discover the Front-end universe, but I really liked JavaScript, not necessarily the language itself but the programming logic, it was wonderful for me to practice programming logic, to create functions to solve problems. I'm still studying, this time OOP with C#, I want to keep learning.

Today I'm studying to become a back-end programmer, more specifically on the .Net platform. Maybe I'll become a full-stack programmer by studying Blazor, but that's in the distant future.
